# CLOG - Code Samples

I am adding interesting code samples here that may not be appropriate as tutorials.  I am using CLOG as a simple blog markup and layout engine here because Common Lisp + CLOG + W3css is so easy to use.  Everything is marked up manually, this is not a real app.  The user interface looks like this:

### Sample 01 - Drag and Drop

This sample is based on the code from 18-tutorial.lisp example. This example provides 3 target drop areas, multiple draggable objects, allows for dragging between targets and shows how we can use w3css classes to change object properties on drop.
